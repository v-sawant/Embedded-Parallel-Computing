# Embedded-Parallel-Computing
It is a coursework in Halmstad University, Sweden. 

## Course Objectives
The course is intended to develop the studentâ€™s knowledge and understanding of how parallel computing can be used, as a way to meet application demands in embedded systems, such as performance and power effciency. Further, it is intended to give a general insight into current research and development in regard to parallel architectures and computation models. Parallelism of various types exists in all modern computer architectures, and knowledge about how to apply parallelism is necessary, in particular, when designing embedded computer systems.
